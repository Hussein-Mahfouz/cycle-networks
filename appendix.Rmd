# Reproducing the results for other cities

To reproduce the results presented for Manchester for other cities there are a few computing pre-requisites:

- A reasonably powerful computer, e.g. with 8 GB RAM
- The statistical programming language R installed (we recommend running it in the RStudio editor)
- The source code of the paper repository, which can be download from `url TBC`
